At the moment of this writing, PostgreSQL only supports the FE/BE protocol and is handled by the [postmaster](https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/a1708ab652eaef3e9405d5119721a9a4ecb6fcbd/src/backend/postmaster/postmaster.c).

In PostgreSQL, the postmaster is responsible (among other things) for initiating the processes that will handle the connections request.

Basically, the postmaster just waits for a new connection request to arrive, when it comes it creates a new backend process to handle the communication for that connection.

The communication is handled by the [pq_comm](https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/e849f3f1f884ad140b60a24354c6371cbd2efbb6/src/backend/libpq/pqcomm.c)

<div class="mermaid">
sequenceDiagram
    Client->>+postmaster: ;
    postmaster->>+postmaster: ConnCreate(ListenSocket[i]);
    postmaster->>+pq_comm: StreamConnection(serverFd, port);
</div>

Given that the postmaster interacts directly with the pq_comm, is not possible to
support more protocols without modifying the postmaster.

Babelfish supports protocol hooks by modifying several aspects of the PostgreSQL
connection management.

In Babelfish, when the postmaster starts, looks for which are the supported
protocols.

This happens during postmaster initialization phase.

<div class="mermaid">
sequenceDiagram
    main->>postmaster:PostmasterMain ;
    postmaster->>tds_srv:list_init_hook ;
    tds_srv->>tds_srv:pe_listen_init ;
</div>

Babelfish also holds in the postmaster a connection callback functions for every
socket that is created, that way it can instruct which protocol will be used be
each socket.

<div class="mermaid">
sequenceDiagram
    Client->>+postmaster: ;
    postmaster->>+postmaster: ConnCreate(ListenSocket[i], ListenConfig[i]);
    postmaster->>+port: proto_config(serverFd, port)->fn_accept ;
</div>
